# odis
Odis, the Latin god of modular limitation. :crystal_ball:

If you need `debounce` or `throttle`, Odis can help. Odis is the Latin god of modular limitation. Odis is a very helpful god.

Odis' name comes from *modularis* (modular) and *modus* (limitation). :zap:

He also believes in being used internally in a project, just drop [these lines](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/odis/blob/master/odis.js#L8-L41) somewhere in your lib, the only downfall is that you won't have access to Odis' shortcuts, but you also won't be adding anything to the global object if you are properly wrapping your project. :tada:

Like most gods, Odis hates typing. For this reason, he set up *very small* shortcuts for accessing his functions. :watch:

`odis.debounce(func, delay)` may be expressed as `odis.debo()` or just `odis.d()`. Note that the delay argument is optional. The default debounce timeout is `210`.

`odis.throttle(func, delay)` may be expressed as `odis.thro()` or just `odis.t()`. Again, the delay argument is optional. The default throttle timeout is `42`.

I wrote about the origins of `odis` in [this blog post](https://ryanpcmcquen.org/javascript/2015/11/28/writing-my-own-throttle.html).
